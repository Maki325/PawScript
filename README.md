# PawScript

PawScript is a statically typed programming language made because why not.

## Goals:
- [x] Compiled
- [x] Interpreted
- [ ] Turing-complete
- [ ] Self-hosted
- [ ] Statically typed
- [ ] Type checking


## Features

### Variables
While the language is statically typed, types are only needed if the variable doesn't have a value assigned as they can be infered
```c
int initializedVariale = 45;
int uninitializedVariable;
```

### Arithmetics
```c
int numberOne = 34
int sum = numberOne + 35
int difference = sum - 35 - 8 + 23
```
